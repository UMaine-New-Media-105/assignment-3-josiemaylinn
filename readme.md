For this assignment, I was tasked with using conditional variables as well as moving sprites to create a simple game where the player must catch a seed.

For the first question, I made the avatar sprite that was going to catch the ball. I wanted to make this fairly simple so I used a few different circles with different colors.

Secondly, I created the environment the game was going to be played in. I opted for a simple, light blue background. I also started to make the game playable by assigning the avatar to a static Y position, while making it movable using the MouseX variable that is built into p5js.

Third, I added a function that made a seed sprite drop at a random X value from the top of the canvas when running the program.

Fourth, I modified the code to generate a seed when clicking rather than at the start of the program. I did this using the mouseButton function, which acts as a switch. While holding down the button, the avatar sprite also changes to look like its holding up its hands.

For the final iteration, I edited the code so that when the avatar and seed sprites overlapped, the avatar changed to indicate that the seed was caught. I changed the code so that the avatar's body would turn green when you win.
